This is a simple web application that parses a .json file and displays certain information.

Parses through json only using controller, at app/controllers/patient_info_controller.rb

Displays info at app/views/patient_info/index.html.erb

The application could be developed more to parse through many files or display pages of information where you can search through many patients.
